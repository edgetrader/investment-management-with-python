# Investment Management with Python
First course of the “Investment Management with Machine Learning and Python” specialization offered by EDHEC Business School on coursera.

## Summary
This course taught you how to build efficient portfolios: starting from the basic Markowitz framework for a focus on diversification, and then moving on to Liability-Driven Investing (LDI) and Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) for a focus on hedging and insurance, respectively.  Also comprehended the fundamental concepts of asset pricing and the most used risk measures for a portfolio.

## Dynamic Liability-Driven Investing Strategies: The Emergence of a New Investment Paradigm for Pension Funds?
Liability-Driven Investing (LDI) paradigm, is a general investment framework that advocates the allocation of pension fund assets to two distinct portfolios, a performance-seeking portfolio (PSP) and a liability-hedging portfolio (LHP), in addition to residual long or short investments in cash. 

The purpose of the LHP is to provide a hedge against unexpected changes in the risk factors that impact liability value.  Because this value equals the present value of promised pension payments, the relevant risk factors are those that impact either the discount rate (typically interest rate risk and credit risk) or the cash flows (inflation risk for instance).

## Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance
Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) is a type of portfolio insurance in which the investor sets a floor on the dollar value of their portfolio, then structures asset allocation around that decision. The two asset classes used in CPPI are a risky asset (usually equities or mutual funds) and a conservative asset of either cash, equivalents or treasury bonds. The percentage allocated to each depends on the "cushion" value, defined as current portfolio value minus floor value, and a multiplier coefficient, where a higher number denotes a more aggressive strategy.
