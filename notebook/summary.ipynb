    "Liability-Driven Investing (LDI) paradigm, is a general investment framework that advocates the allocation of pension fund assets to two distinct portfolios, a performance-seeking portfolio (PSP) and a liability-hedging portfolio (LHP), in addition to residual long or short investments in cash. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the LHP is to provide a hedge against unexpected changes in the risk factors that impact liability value. Because this value equals the present value of promised pension payments, the relevant risk factors are those that impact either the discount rate (typically interest rate risk and credit risk) or the cash flows (inflation risk for instance).\n",
